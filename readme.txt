Tie a page to a master page to adopt the master content. If you change the master page, the changes are automatically applied to the tied page(s).

== Description ==

Every now and then you need a page at multiple locations on your site because you dont know where the user will be looking for it. With this Wordpress plugin you can create multiple pages and by tying them together you only have to edit the master page once in order to apply changes to all of them.

Tie a page to another one through a simple dropdown menu. The chosen page will then be the master. Changes made to the master page are automatically applied to all the pages tied to it. If a page is a tied page its content or title canâ€™t be changed unless you untie it. You can enter a different title for a tied page. This alternate title will not get overwritten by the master page title.
